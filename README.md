# Loan Approval and Repayment Workflow in DAML

## 1. Prerequisites: Installing DAML and Adding to Path

To begin working with DAML, you need to install the DAML SDK and add it to your systemâ€™s path:

1. Download the DAML SDK from the official [DAML website](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html).
2. After installation, ensure that the `daml` command is added to your system's path.
    - For **Linux/macOS** users:
      ```bash
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.daml/bin
      ```
    - For **Windows** users:
      Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html#adding-daml-to-your-path) for adding the `daml` command to your PATH.

3. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   daml version
   ```

## 2. Running the Tests

To ensure the correctness of the workflow, we have provided test cases for each part of the loan approval, disbursement, and repayment system. To run all the test cases:

1. Navigate to the root of the repository.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   daml test
   ```
    This will run all the DAML test cases defined for the system.

3. To run a specific test case, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   daml test --files <path-to-test-file>
   ```
   Replace `<path-to-test-file>` with the path to the test file you want to run.
